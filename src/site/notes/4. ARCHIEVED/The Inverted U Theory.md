- **Arousal** is the level of activation and alertness experienced by a performer
- The 'inverted U' theory proposes that sporting performance improves as arousal levels increase but that there is a threshold point. Any increase in arousal beyond the threshold point will worsen performance

**3 levels of arousal :**
- At low arousal levels, performance quality is low. This is described as **under-arousal** or **boredom** and might be experienced by an elite tennis player playing a lowly ranked opponent.
- At medium arousal levels, sporting performance peaks. This can be described as **optimal arousal** and might be experienced when a boxer gets themselves in the right 'zone' to perform at their best.
- At high arousal levels, performance quality deteriorates. This can be described as **panic** and might explain why a football player performs very poorly when their team is losing 3-0.
